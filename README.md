# ImageMend

## Features

- **AI-Powered Image Restoration:** Enhance image resolution and restore faded colors using advanced AI algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple drag-and-drop functionality for uploading images.
- **Real-Time Processing Visualization:** Visual indicators showing the progress of image enhancement.
- **Download Enhanced Images:** Easily download the processed images in high quality.

## How It Works

ImageMend leverages two key algorithms to process and enhance images:

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** are employed to generate realistic textures and details in images. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work in tandem to produce high-fidelity images. In ImageMend, GANs analyze the input image to create enhanced textures that blend seamlessly with the original content, ensuring that the enhanced image maintains natural aesthetics.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are utilized to sharpen image details and remove artifacts. CNNs process the image to identify and enhance edges, improving overall clarity and visual sharpness. This process ensures that the enhanced image is free from unwanted distortions and retains its original quality while showcasing improved details.

### Processing Workflow

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload an image via the drag-and-drop interface.
2. **Resolution Enhancement:** If selected, GANs upscale the image resolution, adding realistic details and textures.
3. **Color Restoration:** CNNs adjust color balance, saturation, and intensity to restore and enhance faded colors.
4. **Final Output:** The processed image is displayed alongside the original, allowing users to compare and download the enhanced version.
